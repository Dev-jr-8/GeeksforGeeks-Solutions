/*
Before implementing any algorithm, we should be thorough with taking inputs. Here, we will learn how to read inputs.
You are given two inputs: a(integer), and b(string). You need to take the input and print a and b separated by a space.*/

 void inputData()
{
       int a;
       string b;
       cin>>a>>b;
       cout<<a<<" "<<b<<endl;
      //Use cin to take input and cout a and b with a space between them. Also use an endl after output
}

/*
Macro is one of the most important part of CPP preprocessors. It allows us
to define variables and functions and it basically works by substituting 
the value or function during the preprocessing stage of code conversion(High level to Low level). 
So, let's dive into preprocessors!

You are given two inputs: a(integer),and b(integer). You need to print a * b .*/

void macros(int a,int b)
{
    //See the macro defined at the top of the code. Use that macro to find a*b
    //Use only macro to complete this task
    
    cout<<a*b<<endl;
}
